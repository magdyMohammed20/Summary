(1) Private Modifier
-----------------------
==> When Mark Class Property As Private You Can Use It Only Inside The Class And Can't Assign Value Using Class Instance


EX
---

    class Player {
        readonly first: string;
        last: string;
        private score: number; // Mark score As Private Field

        constructor(first: string, last: string, score: number) {
            this.first = first;
            this.last = last;
            this.score = score;
        }
    }

    const p1 = new Player("Magdy", "Mohammed", 10);
    p1.score = 20 // Error : Property 'score' is private and only accessible within class 'Player'


(2) Private Modifier Using (#)
---------------------------------
==> # Is A Js Feature To Mark Property As Private


EX
----

    class Player {
        readonly first: string;
        last: string;
        #score: number = 0; // Mark score As Private Field

        constructor(first: string, last: string, score: number) {
            this.first = first;
            this.last = last;
            this.#score = score;
        }
    }

    const p1 = new Player("Magdy", "Mohammed", 10);
    p1.#score = 10 // Error : Property '#score' is not accessible outside class 'Player' because it has a private identifier


(3) Private Method
---------------------

EX1
-----

    class Player {
        readonly first: string;
        last: string;

        constructor(first: string, last: string) {
            this.first = first;
            this.last = last;
            this.secretMethod() // Calling Private Method In Constructor
        }

        // Define Private Method
        private secretMethod(): void {
            console.log("Hellow Secret")
        }
    }

    const p1 = new Player("Magdy", "Mohammed");

EX2
-----

    class Player {
        readonly first: string;
        last: string;

        constructor(first: string, last: string) {
            this.first = first;
            this.last = last;
        }

        private secretMethod(): void {
            console.log("Hellow Secret")
        }
    }

    const p1 = new Player("Magdy", "Mohammed");
    p1.secretMethod() // Error As secretMethod Is Private But It Work Normally When Compiled To Js
