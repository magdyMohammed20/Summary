(2) TS File Extensions
-------------------------
==> TypeScript has two main kinds of files. '.ts' files 
    are implementation files that contain types and 
    executable code. These are the files that produce 
    .js outputs, and are where you’d normally write your code.
    And Second Kind Is '.d.ts'


(3) (.d.ts) File Extension
-----------------------------
==> files are declaration files that contain only type information. 
    These files don’t produce .js outputs; they are only used for 
    typechecking. We’ll learn more about how to write our own declaration.
