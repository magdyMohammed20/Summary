(1) Different Between Interfaces And 'type' Annotation
--------------------------------------------------------
==> Interface Define Type Of Object But 'type' Define Type Of Object And Variables
    ==> With Interface You Can Redeclare The Interface And There Is No Overrides It Append Only
    With 'type' You Can't Redeclare The 'type'


    ==> Inheritance Can Occur In Interfaces And In 'type' Too

// Inheritance In 'type'

type Person = {
    name: string
}

type Employee = Person & {
    job: string
}

const emp: Employee = {
    name: 'Magdy',
    job: 'FrontEnd'
}
