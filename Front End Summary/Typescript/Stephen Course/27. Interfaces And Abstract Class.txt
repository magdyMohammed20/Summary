(1) Different Between Interfaces And Abstract Class
-----------------------------------------------------

==> Interfaces
-----------------
--> Setup A Contract Between Different Classes
--> Use When We Have Very Different Objects That We Want To Work Together
--> Promotes Loose Coupling


==> Abstract Class
-------------------
--> Setup A Contract Between Different Classes
--> Use When We Are Trying To Build Up A Definition Of An Object
--> Strongly Couples Classes Together
