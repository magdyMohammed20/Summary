(1) Install Redux In Project
-----------------------------
==> npm i redux react-redux


(2) Create [Components] Folder In [src] Folder That Contains [Cakes.js]
    Component That Contains Display Of Current Number Of Cakes

(3) Create [Redux] Folder That Contains 
----------------------------------------
3.1) File Called [ActionTypes] That Contains All Actions That Are Exported To Use It In [CakeActions.js]
3.2) File Called [CakeActions.js] That Contains All Exported Actions Creators And Import [ActionTypes.js] Variables
3.3) File Called [CakeReducer.js] That Contains The initialState And Exported Reducer Function And Import [ActionTypes.js] Variables
3.4) File Called [Store.js] That Contains [createStore] Import And [CakeReducer] Import And Exported [store]

(4) Connect The Application With [Store.js] By Import The [Provider] In [App.js]
    And Import [store.js] Then Wrap All [App.js] Component Content Inside [<Provider>]
    Tag And Pass The Imported Store To Provider Tag [<Provider store={Store}></Provider>]


(7) In [Cakes.js] Will Create [mapStateToProps] And [mapDispatchToProps] Functions
    But We Want To Access Action Creators To Pass It To [mapStateToProps]
    So I Will Create [index.js] File In [Redux] Folder That Contains All Exported Action Creators
    Then Import All Action Creators In [Cakes.js] File Then Pass It To [mapDispatchToProps]

(8) Connect [mapDispatchToProps] And [mapStateToProps] With [Cakes.js] Buy Using [Connect]
    KeyWord That Imported From 'react-redux'

(9) Now You Can Access [numOfCakes] Value And [buyCake] Function As Props In [Cakes.js] Component
