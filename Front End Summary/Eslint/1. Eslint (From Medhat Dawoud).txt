(1) Eslint
-----------
==> tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, with the goal of making code more consistent and avoiding bugs. In many ways, it is similar to JSLint and JSHint with a few exceptions
-> ESLint uses Espree for JavaScript parsing.
-> ESLint uses an AST to evaluate patterns in code.
-> ESLint is completely pluggable, every single rule is a plugin and you can add more at runtime.
