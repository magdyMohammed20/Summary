(1) Assertions
-----------------
==> When Write Tests We Need To Check That Values Meet Certain Conditions
==> Assertions Decide If A Test Passes Or Fail

(2) Assertions Executed Using execute(value) function
-------------------------------------------------------
==> Argument Should Be Value That Your Code Produces
==> Use Expect Along With "Matcher" function to assert something about a value
==> Matcher Can Optionally accept argument which is the correct expected value

EX (toBeInTheDocument() Is The Matcher)
---
    expect(screen.getByText('Hello)).toBeInTheDocument()

(3) In Package.json And By default with react there are lib called "@testing-library/jest-dom" Which Contains A Lot of matchers

(4) By Default In ReactJs Project There Are File called 'setupTests.js' Which Exexuted Before All Tests
