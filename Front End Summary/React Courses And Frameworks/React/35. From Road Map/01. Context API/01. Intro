(1) If We Have The Following Components Structure

			---------------
			 App Component
	--------------------------------------------------
	|                      |                         |		
	
        A                      B                         C
        
                               |                         |
                               
                               D                         E
                                                         
                                                         |
                                                         
                                                         F

(2) If The [App Component] Contains 'userName' And I Want To Access 'userName' Inside A , D , F Components
    With Traditional Way We Will Send 'userName' As Props To A Directly , Send 'userName' To B As Props
    Then Send 'userName' From B To D As Props , Send 'userName' As Props To C Then Pass 'userName' From C To E As Props Then Pass 'userName' From E To F As Props But Context Solve This Problems
    

(3) Context API Provides Way To Pass Data Through The Component Tree Without Having To Pass Props Down Manually At Every Level
