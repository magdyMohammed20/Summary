(1) next build , start , export
---------------------------------
==> next build : Build App For Production In '.next' Folder
==> next start : start nodeJs Server That Supports Hybrid Pages , serving Both Statically Generated And Server Side Rendered Pages 
==> next export : Export All Pages To Static Html Files That You Can Server Without Need Of NodeJs Server
                  [Like : Landing Pages Or Blogs Or Any Content Generated At Build Time]


(2) For Using [next export] Configure 'scripts' Object In [Package.json] 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

    "scripts": {
        "dev": "next dev",
        "build": "next build",
        "start": "next start",
        "export": "next build && next export", // Look Here
    }

(3) When Run [yarn export] Will Give Error If Using [Image] Component Inside Any Page Or Component 
    And Will Give Error If Use 'getServerSideProps' In Any Page So Can Use 'getStaticProps' Instead
    And Will Give Error If Don't Use 'getStaticPaths' In Any Dynamic Route So Must Set 'getStaticPaths' With [fallback: false] As It Will Give Error If 'true'

(4) After Fixing All Errors Run [yarn export] Again Will Note That All Static Html Files Generated Inside Folder Called 'out' In Your Project
