(1) 2 Forms Of Pre-Rendering
-------------------------------
==> Static Generation 
==> Server Side Rendering

(2) Static Generation
-------------------------
==> Html Statically Generated At Build Time , Built Page Is Then Cashed And Reused For Each Request
==> For Dynamic Pages With 'getStaticpaths' And Fallback Set To True The Page Not Generated At Build Time But Is Generated In Initial Request
==> With ISR Page Can Be Re-Generated For A Request After The Revalidation Time Has Elapsed

(3) Problems With Static Generation
------------------------------------
==> Can't Fetch Data At Request Time [Run Into Problem Of Stale Data (Which Data Updated Without Reflected To User Screen)] And Not Optimize For SEO
==> We Don't Get Access To Incoming Request If Page Pre-Rendered At Build Time

(4) Server Side Rendering (SSR)
-----------------------------------
==> Allow You To Pre-Render Page At Request Time Not Build Time 
==> HTML Generated For Every Incoming Request
