(1) Using Typescript With NextJs
----------------------------------
==> First : Create 'tsconfig.json' Inside Your Project But If Run [yarn dev] Will Give Error As Require Some Typescript Packages
==> Add Packages Using [yarn add --dev typescript @types/react @types/node] Then Run [yarn dev] Again
==> But If Use 'Absolute Imports' Or 'module Paths' Must Transfer 'compilerOptions' To 'tsconfig.json'

(2) Note That NextJs Has It's Own Structure With Data Fetching And All Other Things You Can See It In NextJs Docs
