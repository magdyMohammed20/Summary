(1) The Three Core Concepts Of Redux
-----------------------------------
=> Store: Is Object That Holds State Of Application
=> Action: Is Object That Describes What Happened And Should Contains Type Property
=> Reducer: Is Function That Connect Store With Action
            And Takes 2 Parameters [Current State , Action]
            And Based On Action Type Will Return New State Object


(2) Three Concepts Overview
-----------------------------
==> Application State Will Be In The Redux Store But Application Can't Access
    The Store Directly
==> Application Will Dispatch The Action And Action Sended To Reducer
    And Reducer Handle The Action And Update Current State Then Passed
    Passed To The Redux Store
