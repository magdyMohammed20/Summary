(1) What Is Hooks
------------------
==> New Feature Addition In React v16.8 Which Allow You To Use React Features Without Having To Write A Class
    [EX: Write State Component Without Have To Create Class Component]

(2) React Hooks Doesn't Work Inside Classes But Your Application Can Contains Classes And Functional 	     	 Components With Hooks


(3) Why React Hooks
----------------------
==> In Class You Have To Understand How 'this' Keyword Work And 'this' In Js Is Different From Any Other Language
==> Remember To Bind Event Handlers In Class Components
==> Class Don't Minify Very Well And Make Hot Reloading Very Unreliable
==> There Is No Way To Reuse Stateful Component Logic
==> in Class Component The Related Code Isn't Orgnized In One Place
    [EX: When Fetch The Data You Set The Code In componentDidMount And componentDidUpdate]
==> Beacuse Of Class Stateful Logic Can't Break Components Into Smaller Ones
