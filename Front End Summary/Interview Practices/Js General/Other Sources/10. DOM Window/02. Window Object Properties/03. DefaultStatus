(1) DefaultStatus
------------------
==> sets or returns the default text in the status bar at the bottom of the browser (the text will be displayed when the page loads)

==> The defaultStatus property does not work in the default configuration of IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari or Opera 15 and newer. To allow scripts to change the text of the status, the user must set the dom.disable_window_status_change preference to false in the about:config screen. (or in Firefox: "Tools - Options - Content -Enable JavaScript / Advanced - Allow scripts to change status bar text").


==> Opera 12 and earlier supports this property. However, support was removed in version 15.

==> Firefox removed this property in version 23.
