(1) Name
-----------
==> sets or returns the name of the window.

==> used to modify the name of a window, after the window has been created.

==> The name of the window is often used for setting targets for hyperlinks and forms. However, this is not required, as windows do not need to have names

	document.getElementById('btn').onclick = () => {
	    var win = window.open("", "mego") // Create Window With Name "mego"
	    win.document.write(win.name) // Write Window Name In The Created Window Document
	}
	
	
EX: Set Window Name
--------------------

	window.name = "mego"
