(1) Containers
---------------
==> Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align your content withing a given device or viewport


(2) Bootstrap comes with three different containers
-----------------------------------------------------
==> .container, which sets a max-width at each responsive breakpoint
==> .container-fluid, which is width: 100% at all breakpoints
==> .container-{breakpoint}, which is width: 100% until the specified breakpoint


(3) All Available Containers
------------------------------
==> .container
==> .container-sm
==> .container-md
==> .container-lg
==> .container-xl
==> .container-xxl
==> .container-fluid


(4) Responsive containers [.container-sm , .container-md , .container-lg , .container-xl , .container-xxl]
--------------------------
==> Responsive containers allow you to specify a class that is 100% wide until the specified breakpoint is reached, after which we apply max-widths for each of the higher breakpoints. For example, .container-sm is 100% wide to start until the sm breakpoint is reached, where it will scale up with md, lg, xl, and xxl.
