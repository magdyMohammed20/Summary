(1) Automated Test Types
---------------------------
==> Unit Tests
==> Integration Tests
==> E2E Tests

(2) Unit Tests
------------------
==> Testing The Individual Building Blocks Of App (Class - Function - Component)
==> Each Unit Or Building Blocks Tested In Isolation , Independent Of Other Units
==> Run In Short Time , And Make It Very Easy To Pinpoint Failures
==> Relatively Easy To Write And Maintain

(3) Integration Test
-----------------------
==> Testing Combination Of Units And Ensuring They Work Together
==> Take Longer Time Than Unit Test

(4) E2E Test
---------------
==> Testing The Entire App Flow And Ensuring It Works As Designed From Start To Finish
==> Involves (Real UI - Real Backend DB - Real Services , etc...)
==> Take Longest As They Cover The Most Amount Of Code 
==> Have Cost Implication As You Interact With Real API That May Charge Based On The Number  Of Requests

(5) React Testing Lib Will Strikes The Balance Between Unit And E2E Tests
