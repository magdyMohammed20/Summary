(1) Static Analysis testing
------------------------------

==> Process of verifying that your code meets certain expectations without actually running it

==> Ensure consistent style and formatting
• Check for common mistakes and possible bugs
• Limit the complexity of code and
• Verify type consistency

==> All types of tests run the code and then compare the outcome against known expected outputs to see if everything works OK

==> Static testing analyses aspects such as readability, consistency, error handling, type checking, and alignment with best practices

==> Testing checks if your code works or not, whereas static analysis checks if it is written well or not
