(1) user events
-----------------
==> A companion library for Testing Library that simulates user interactions by dispatching the events that would happen if the interaction took place in a browser 
==> It is the recommended way to test user interactions with RTL 

(2) fireEvent vs user-event 
--------------------------------
==> fireEvent is a method from RTL which is used to dispatch DOM events 
==> user-event simulates full interactions, which may fire multiple events and do additional checks along the way
==> For example, we can dispatch the change event on an input field using fireEvent 
==> When a user types into a text box, the element has to be focused, and then keyboard and input events are fired and the selection and value on the element are manipulated as they type 
==> user-event allows you to describe a user interaction instead of a concrete event. It adds visibility and intractability checks along the way and manipulates the DOM just like a user interaction in the browser would. It factors in that the browser e.g. wouldn't let a user click a hidden element or type in a disabled text box
