--------------------------------------------
==> In Your NextJs App There Are Folder Called 'styles' Which Contains 'globals.css' File And Imported Inside '/pages/_app.js'
==> So If Want To Create Global Style Must Import Css File In '_app.js'
==> If Want To Use Bootstrap Globally So Must Install Bootstrap [yarn add bootstrap] Then Import Bootstrap Css File In '_app.js' [import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"]
