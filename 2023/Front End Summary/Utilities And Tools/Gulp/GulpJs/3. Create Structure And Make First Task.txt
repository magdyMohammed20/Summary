(1) Inside Project Folder That I Create It In The Previous Lesson
    I Will Create Another Folder And Give It Any Name [EX: Project]
    And This Folder Will Contain All Files That In Development Stage
    [EX: Sass Files , Images , ....]

(2) And Create Another Folder Inside Gulp Project Folder And This Folder
    Created For Project Production And Called It For Example [dist]

(3) And Create Another File Inside Gulp Project Folder That Called
    [gulpfile.js] And You Must Named This File With This Name As Gulp
    Project Don't Run Without This File Name , Then I Will Create My First
    Task In This File By This Way
------------------------------------------------------------------

    // Import gulp Module From Node_Modules Folder
    var gulp = require('gulp');

    // First Task
    gulp.task('taskName' , function(){
        // Code
    });

    EX:
    -----

    var gulp1 = require('gulp');

    gulp1.task('mego',() =>{
        console.log('Hellow Mego In The First Gulp Task');
    });


(4) Then I Will Run The Project By Using The CMD And First You Should Be
    Focused On Project Folder By Using [cd Project_Name]
    Then I Will Run The Task That I Create It By Using This Command
    [gulp taskName]

(5) If There Is Any Problem In Task Run You Can Install Another Version
    Of Gulp Like [npm install gulp@3.9.0]
