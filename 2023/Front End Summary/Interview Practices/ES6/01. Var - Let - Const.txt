    ------------------

        const x = {
                name: "Magdy",
                age:20
        };

        console.log(x); // {name: "Magdy", age: 20}
            x.name = 'Mohammed';
        console.log(x); // {name: "Mohammed", age: 20}

    - Use Object.freeze() For Prevent To Edit Object Constant Values
    ----------------------

        const x = { name: "Magdy", age:20 };

        Object.freeze(x);

        x.name = 'Mohammed';
        x.age = 40;

        console.log(x); // {name: "Magdy", age: 20}
