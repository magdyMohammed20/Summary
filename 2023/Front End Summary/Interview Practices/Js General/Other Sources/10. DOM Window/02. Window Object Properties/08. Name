-----------
==> sets or returns the name of the window.

	document.getElementById('btn').onclick = () => {
	    var win = window.open("", "mego") // Create Window With Name "mego"
	    win.document.write(win.name) // Write Window Name In The Created Window Document
	}
	
	
EX: Set Window Name
--------------------

	window.name = "mego"
