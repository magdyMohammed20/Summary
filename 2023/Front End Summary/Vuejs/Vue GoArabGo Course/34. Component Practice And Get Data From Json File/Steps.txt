(1) You Can Use Bootstrap And FontAwesome For Grid System And Icons
(2) Bulit Bootstrap Card And Set It In Component Called [EX: course]
    And Call This Component Inside template Attribute In The Vue Instance
(3) Set props Or Argument For Component That Have The Data
    That I Want To Display It [# Of Lessons , # Of Likes ...]
    And This Attribute Is Object That Have All Data That I Want To
    Display It And I Will Make Bind For This Attribute From Another Attribute That
    Have The Real Data In The Vue Instance

    And I Will Make Function Inside [methods] Attribute In Vue Instance At The Following
    Form For Get The Data From API And Replace [/someUrl] With Link Of [.Json] File
    And Replace [this.someData] With [this.courses]
    [Note: this.courses Is Empty Array That I Will Create It For Store Data]

    getCourses:function(){
      {
        // GET /someUrl
        this.$http.get('js/courses.json').then(response => {

          // get body data
          this.courses = response.body;

        }, response => {
          // error callback
        });
      }
    }
