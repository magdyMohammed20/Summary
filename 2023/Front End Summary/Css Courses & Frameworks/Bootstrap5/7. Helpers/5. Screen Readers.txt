(1) Screen Readers
-------------------
==> Use screen reader utilities to hide elements on all devices except screen readers.
    with .sr-only. Use .sr-only-focusable to show the element only when itâ€™s focused 
    (e.g. by a keyboard-only user). Can also be used as mixins.

    <h2 class="sr-only">Title for screen readers</h2>
    <a class="sr-only-focusable" href="#content">Skip to main content</a>
