(1) Type Annotation
-------------------------
==> Tell TS The Variable Type

var x: number;
x = 10

var str: string;
str = 'magdy'


    (2) Type Inference
-----------------------
==> Don't Need To Tell Variable Type Which Is Infered From TS

var x = "magdy" // TS Infered That Type Of X Is String Because Of It Have String Value
