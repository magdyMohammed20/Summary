(1) Let VS Var VS Const
-------------------------

==> var   : Non Blocked Scoped (Function Scope)   - Can ReAssign And Redeclare         - Hoisted (undefined)
==> let   : Has Function Scope And Block Scope    - Can ReAssign But Not Redeclared    - Hoisted (No Initialization)
==> const : Has Function Scope And Block Scope    - Can't ReAssign And Not Redeclared  - Hoisted (No Initialization)


(2) anonymous function
---------------------------
==> a function that does not have a name. 
==> usually created for specific tasks and are often assigned to variables or used as arguments for other functions (SetTimeout - map - IIFE - Arrow Functions - )


(3) Clousres
---------------
==> دالة داخلية تحتفظ بمتغيرات الدالة الخارجية حتى بعد انتهاء تنفيذها

        function outerFunction() {
            let count = 0; // متغير داخل الدالة الخارجية
            
            function innerFunction() {
                count++; // تستطيع الوصول إلى count حتى بعد انتهاء outerFunction
                console.log(count);
            }
            
            return innerFunction;
        }

        const counter = outerFunction(); // استدعاء الدالة الخارجية

        counter(); // 1
        counter(); // 2
        counter(); // 3


(4) Strict Mode
------------------
==> A mode in JavaScript used to enforce stricter rules when writing code, which helps detect potential errors and prevent some unwanted behaviors.
==> Prevent the use of undefined variables
==> Prevent deletion of variables or functions
==> Prevent assigning a value to non-writable objects
==> Prevent the use of reserved words

EX
---

    "use strict";

    x = 10; // ❌ خطأ: x لم يتم تعريفه باستخدام let أو var أو const
    console.log(x);

(5) ReactJs Life Cycle
------------------------
==> Mounting : component is being inserted into the DOM
==> Update : occurs whenever a component's state or props change
==> unMounting : occurs when a component is being removed from the DOM.


(6) Redux VS Context API
------------------------

==> Context API
-----------------
--> You have a small to medium-sized application with relatively simple state management needs.
--> You want to avoid prop drilling within a specific part of your application.
--> You prefer a simpler setup and don't need advanced features like middleware or time-travel debugging.

==> Redux
-----------------
--> You have a larger application with complex state management requirements.
--> You need to manage global state that is accessed and updated by various parts of your application.
--> You require advanced features like middleware for handling asynchronous operations or need the flexibility of time-travel debugging.


(7) Different Between filter and find
-----------------------------------------

==> filter
------------
--> The filter method creates a new array containing all the elements of the original array that pass a given condition.
--> It iterates over each element of the array and executes a callback function for each element.
--> The callback function should return a boolean value (true or false) to determine whether an element should be included in the resulting array.
--> If no elements satisfy the condition, an empty array will be returned.
--> The filter method does not modify the original array.

==> find
------------
--> The find method returns the first element in the array that satisfies the given condition.
--> It iterates over each element of the array and executes a callback function for each element.
--> The callback function should return a boolean value.
--> If no element satisfies the condition, undefined will be returned.
--> The find method does not modify the original array.


(8) Different between call and bind and apply
---------------------------------------
==> call : Used To Call Function That Inside Object And Update Ohter Prop In Other Object

    // Call : Case1
    const ch1 = {
        name: "magdy",
        health: 60,
        fullHealth() {
            return this.health = 100
        }
    }

    // Here 'this' Refer To The Global Object ('window' In The Browser) Or ('Undefined' In Strict Mode)
    ch1.fullHealth.call()
    console.log(ch1.health) // 60

    // Here 'this' Refer To 'ch1'
    ch1.fullHealth()
    console.log(ch1.health) // 100

    // Call : Case2
    const ch1 = {
        name: "magdy",
        health: 60,
        fullHealth(num1 , num2) {
            return this.health = num1 + num2
        }
    }

    const ch2 = {
        name: "mohammed",
        health: 30
    }

    // Here We Access 'fullHealth' Function And Call It With Context Of 'ch2' Object
    ch1.fullHealth.call(ch2 , 40 , 70)
    console.log(ch2.health) // 110


==> apply : Like Call But Arguments Passed In Array

    const ch1 = {
        name: "magdy",
        health: 60,
        fullHealth(num1 , num2) {
            return this.health = num1 + num2
        }
    }

    const ch2 = {
        name: "mohammed",
        health: 30
    }

    // Passed Array Here
    ch1.fullHealth.apply(ch2 , [40 , 70])
    console.log(ch2.health) // 110


==> bind : Like (Call) But Return Output In a New Function
 
    const ch1 = {
        name: "magdy",
        health: 60,
        fullHealth(num1 , num2) {
            return this.health = num1 + num2
        }
    }

    const ch2 = {
        name: "mohammed",
        health: 30
    }

    const bindFunc = ch1.fullHealth.bind(ch2 , 40 , 70)
    console.log(bindFunc()) // 110


(9) React.memo() VS useMemo() VS useCallback()
--------------------------------------------------
==> React.memo()
----------------
--> higher-order component (HOC) used to Prevents unnecessary re-renders of components


==> useMemo()
--------------
--> built-in React hook That Memoizes expensive calculations that accepts 2 arguments — a function that computes a result and the depedencies array


==> useCallback 
---------------
--> Hook can be used to Memoizes functions to prevent unnecessary recreations


(10) cohersion
------------------
==>  Automatic Type Conversion in JavaScript When Performing Operations Between Data Types

==> Types
----------
--> Implicit Coercion : When JavaScript converts automatically.
--> Explicit Coercion : When we convert manually using functions like Number(), String(), Boolean().

(11) HOC
-------------------
==> advanced method of reusing the component functionality logic. It simply takes the original component and returns the enhanced component


(12) Event Loop
--------------------


(13) Event Bubbling
---------------------
==> is a mechanism where an event triggered on a child element propagates upward through its ancestors in the DOM. It allows parent elements to respond to events triggered by their child elements


(14) Event capturing
---------------------
==> occurs when a nested element gets clicked. The click event of its parent elements must be triggered before the click of the nested element. This phase trickles down from the top of the DOM tree to the target element.

(15) Psueudo Element VS Psueudo Class
---------------------------------------
==> are selectors that allow the styling of specific states or parts of elements
==> Psueudo Element : target states like ': hover' or ': active', while pseudo-elements like ' ::before ' or:: after' style specific parts of an element
==> Psueudo Element : begins with (' :: ') double colon.


==> Pseudo-Classes : selects the element and changes the state of the element based on the user interaction. For Example, Changing the color of the element when the user over it or when the user visits the link.
==> Pseudo-Classes : Pseduo Classes starts with (' : ') name



(16) Promises
----------------
==> JavaScript object that represents an asynchronous operation like API calls, file loading, or time delays easier. Think of a Promise as a placeholder for a value that will be available in the future. It can be in one of three states

    - Pending: The task is in the initial state.
    - Fulfilled: The task was completed successfully, and the result is available.
    - Rejected: The task failed, and an error is provided.


(17) Diff Between (await and then)
--------------------------------------
==> then() :  method available on Promises. It allows handling the result of a Promise once it resolves.
==> then() :  The fetch function returns a Promise ==> The first .then() converts the response into JSON ==> The second .then() logs the data ==> If an error occurs, .catch() handles it
==> Readability : Can become nested and hard to read
==> Error Handling : Uses .catch()
==> Execution Flow : Does not pause execution
==> Where to Use : Can be used anywhere
==> Best for : Multiple Promises and callbacks


==> await : is a keyword that pauses execution inside an async function until a Promise is resolved
==> await : waits until the fetch request completes 
==> Readability : Cleaner and easier to understand
==> Error Handling : Uses try...catch
==> Execution Flow : Pauses execution until the Promise resolves
==> Where to Use : Must be inside an async function
==> Best for : Sequential operations that depend on each other
