(1) Another Way To Compile And Watching TS Files
--------------------------------------------------

==> We Want To Organize Files As Following By Compile 'index.ts' To 'index.js' File In 'build' Folder

    Project
        -src
            -index.ts
        -build
            -index.js

==> We Need To Fix Configuration Of Typescript By Run 'tsc --init' You Will Note That 'tsconfig.json' Created In The Project

==> Edit 'outDir' And 'rootDir' In 'tsconfig.json' 

     "outDir": "./build",                          
     "rootDir": "./src"

==> Run 'tsc' In Terminal You Will Note That './src/index.ts' Converted To './build/index.js'
==> If Want To Prevent Run 'tsc' In Terminal Every Time Add '-w' To Always Watching TS Files 'tsc -w'


(2) Show Ts File Output In Terminal After Each Save
-----------------------------------------------------
==> Run [npm init -y] For Generate 'Package.json'
==> Rum [npm i  nodemon concurrently] (concurrently: Used To Run commands concurrently)

==> Add 'start' Commands In 'Package.json'

    "scripts": {
        "start:build":"tsc -w",
        "start:run":"nodemon ./build/index.js",
        "start":"concurrently npm:start:*"
    }

==> Run [npm start] In Terminal You Note That 'index.ts' Compiled And Give The Output And After Each Save It Compile The 'Ts' File And Give The Output In Terminal
