(1) ReadOnly Property
----------------------

    class Department {

        // Look That Access Adding readOnly To Prevent ReAssign Value Inside Or Outside The Class
        constructor(public readonly id: string, private name: string) { }

        describe(this: Department) {
            this.id = 10 // This Not Allowed As id Is Read Only Prop

            // This Is Allowed Is To Read Id Only Not Change It's Value
            console.log('Department Info : Id : ' + this.id + ' ' + this.name)
        }

    }

    const accounting = new Department("1", 'Accounting')

    accounting.id = 20 // This Not Allowed As id Is Read Only Prop
    accounting.describe() // Department Info : Id : 10 Accounting


(2) Right Way To Deal With ReadOnly
--------------------------------------

    class Department {

        // Look That Access Adding readOnly To Prevent ReAssign Value Inside Or Outside The Class
        constructor(public readonly id: string, private name: string) { }

        describe(this: Department) {
            // Read Only Inside The Class
            console.log('Department Info : Id : ' + this.id + ' ' + this.name)
        }
    }

    const accounting = new Department("1", 'Accounting')

    accounting.describe() // Department Info : Id : 1 Accounting

    // Read Only Outside The Class 
    console.log(accounting.id) // 1
