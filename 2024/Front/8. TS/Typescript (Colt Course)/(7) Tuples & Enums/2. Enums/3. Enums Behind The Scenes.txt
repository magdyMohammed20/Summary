(1) Prevent Enum To Compiled In Final Js File
--------------------------------------------------
==> When Enum Compiled It Appear As Self Called Function With Complex Syntax
==> But If We Add 'const' Before Enum It Compiled As Normal Js Constants Variables


    const enum ResponseStatus {
        PENDING = 10, 
        ERROR = 404,
        SUCCESS = 100
    }
