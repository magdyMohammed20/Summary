- Closures are created whenever a variable that is defined outside the current scope is accessed from within some inner scope. It gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created. To use a closure, simply define a function inside another function and expose it.

## (1) ReactJs Life Cycle

==> Mounting : component is being inserted into the DOM
==> Update : occurs whenever a component's state or props change

## (2) Redux VS Context API

Choose the Context API when:

---

- You have a small to medium-sized application with relatively simple state management needs.
- You want to avoid prop drilling within a specific part of your application.
- You prefer a simpler setup and don't need advanced features like middleware or time-travel debugging.

Choose Redux when:

---

- You have a larger application with complex state management requirements.
- You need to manage global state that is accessed and updated by various parts of your application.
- You require advanced features like middleware for handling asynchronous operations or need the flexibility of time-travel debugging.
