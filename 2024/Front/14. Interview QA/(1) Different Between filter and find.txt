(1) Different Between filter and find
-----------------------------------------

==> filter
------------
--> The filter method creates a new array containing all the elements of the original array that pass a given condition.
--> It iterates over each element of the array and executes a callback function for each element.
--> The callback function should return a boolean value (true or false) to determine whether an element should be included in the resulting array.
--> If no elements satisfy the condition, an empty array will be returned.
--> The filter method does not modify the original array.

==> find
------------
--> The find method returns the first element in the array that satisfies the given condition.
--> It iterates over each element of the array and executes a callback function for each element.
--> The callback function should return a boolean value.
--> If no element satisfies the condition, undefined will be returned.
--> The find method does not modify the original array.
