(1) Problem With Private Modifier
------------------------------------
==> When Class Extends Another Class And Parent Class Has Private Property 
    The Child Class Can't Access This Private Property So We Will Solve It Using Protected

==> Protected Modifier Only Accessible In Child Class


EX (Using Protected Modifier)

    class Player {
        constructor(
            public first: string,
            public last: string,
            protected _score: number) { }

        get fullNameWithScore(): string {
            return `${this.first} ${this.last} And Score Is ${this._score}`;
        }

        set score(val: number) {
            this._score = val;
        }
    }

    class secondPlayer extends Player {
        set scoreChange(val: number) {
            this._score = val;
        }

    }

    const p1 = new secondPlayer("Magdy", "Mohammed", 10);

    p1.scoreChange = 100
    console.log(p1.fullNameWithScore) // Magdy Mohammed And Score Is 100
