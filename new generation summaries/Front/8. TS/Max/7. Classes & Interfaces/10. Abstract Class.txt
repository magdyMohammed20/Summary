(1) Abstract Class
--------------------
==> Define Using abstract keyword. 
==> Abstract classes are mainly for inheritance where other classes may derive from them. 
==> We cannot create an instance of an abstract class.
==> An abstract class typically includes one or more abstract methods or property declarations. The class which extends the abstract class must define all the abstract methods

    abstract class Department {

        constructor(
            public readonly id: string
        ) { }

        abstract describe(this: Department);
    }



    class ITDepartment extends Department {

        constructor(id: string) {
            super(id)
        }

        describe() {
            console.log(this.id)
        }
    }

    const it = new ITDepartment('it1')
    it.describe() // it1
